## Custom Flight Dynamics Engine
  
One of the most impressive features of the FSX Majestic Software Dash 8 Q400 V1.012 DRM Free edition is the custom flight dynamics engine, which is independent from the default FSX flight dynamics engine. This means that the aircraft behaves more realistically and responds to the environmental conditions more accurately. The custom flight dynamics engine simulates various aspects of the aerodynamics, such as wind effects, icing effects, propeller physics, propeller discing and auto rotation, propeller airstream effects on wing lift, and more. The result is a more challenging and rewarding flying experience that requires proper handling and management of the aircraft.
  
## Weather Radar and TCAS
  
The FSX Majestic Software Dash 8 Q400 V1.012 DRM Free edition also features a fully functional weather radar and traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS). The weather radar can interpolate the weather returns based on the actual FSX weather using the FSX weather stations reports. It can also work with third-party weather addons that can set the per-station weather. The weather radar can display different modes, such as ground mapping, weather shadow, ground clutter, and more. The TCAS can simulate most of the ICAO-defined CASII functions and provide traffic indication and advisories. The TCAS works with both AI traffic and online network traffic (Vatsim/IVAO).
  
## Dual Flight Management System
  
The FSX Majestic Software Dash 8 Q400 V1.012 DRM Free edition also comes with a dual flight management system (FMS) that simulates the Universal 1E FMS. The FMS is capable of navigation in three dimensions (LNAV+VNAV), RNP-based navigation, fuel and performance management, and more. The FMS can use an up-to-date navigation database provided by Navigraph (subject to additional charges) to obtain the latest procedures and waypoints.
  
## Other Features
  
The FSX Majestic Software Dash 8 Q400 V1.012 DRM Free edition also offers many other features that enhance the realism and immersion of the simulation, such as:
  
- A custom sound system that uses Direct-X based sound effects and custom DSP effects to simulate the propeller sounds correctly.
- A high resolution liveries package that includes 19 liveries from various airlines around the world.
- A custom animations and lighting system that includes wing flex, propeller blades pitch, passenger doors, service hatches, landing gear suspension, wheel chocks, GPU unit, windshield wipers, sun visors, dynamic wing views, volumetric lighting effects, cockpit lighting effects, etc.
- A documentation package that includes a user manual, a tutorial flight manual, a quick start guide, a systems description manual, etc.

## Conclusion
  
The FSX Majestic Software Dash 8 Q400 V1.012 DRM Free edition is a must-have for any flight simulator enthusiast who wants to fly a realistic turboprop aircraft. It offers a high level of detail and accuracy in both visual and systems aspects. It also provides a challenging and rewarding flying experience that requires proper skills and knowledge to master.
