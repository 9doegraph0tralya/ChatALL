The movie has some hilarious scenes that showcase the culture clash between the villagers and the city dwellers. For instance, when Devki's father tries to bribe the cop with his underwear money, or when Devki's mother cooks a feast for the entire neighborhood with a single gas cylinder. The movie also has some emotional moments that highlight the bond between Devki and his family, and between Devki and Madan. The movie also has some catchy songs that add to the fun quotient.
 
However, the movie is not without its flaws. The plot is predictable and cliched, and the climax is too convenient and unrealistic. The movie also drags in some parts and could have been edited better. The movie also fails to explore the serious issues of migration and regionalism in a deeper way, and settles for a superficial and simplistic message. The movie also relies too much on stereotypes and caricatures, and does not offer much novelty or freshness.
 
Overall, *Na Ghar Ke Na Ghaat Ke* is a decent attempt at making a light-hearted comedy with a social message. It may not be a masterpiece, but it is certainly worth a watch for its sincere performances and its occasional laughs.
