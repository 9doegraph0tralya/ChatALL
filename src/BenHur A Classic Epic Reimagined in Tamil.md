Now, Ben-Hur has been remade in 2016 with a new cast and a new vision. The film, directed by Timur Bekmambetov and starring Jack Huston, Toby Kebbell, Morgan Freeman and Rodrigo Santoro, is a thrilling action-adventure that brings the epic story to life with modern technology and stunning visuals. The film also features a Tamil dubbed version, which allows the Tamil audience to enjoy the film in their own language.
 
The Tamil dubbed version of Ben-Hur is not just a simple translation of the English dialogue. It is a creative adaptation that captures the essence and spirit of the original film, while also adding some local flavor and cultural references. The Tamil dubbing team, led by veteran actor and dubbing artist Ravi Shankar, has done a commendable job of making the film accessible and engaging for the Tamil viewers.
 
Ben-Hur is not just a movie about revenge and redemption. It is also a movie about faith and forgiveness. It explores the themes of friendship, loyalty, justice, mercy and love. It shows how one man's journey can change the course of history and inspire millions. It is a movie that transcends time and culture, and speaks to the universal human condition.
 
Ben-Hur is a movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen. It is a movie that will entertain, inspire and move you. It is a movie that will make you feel like you are part of an epic adventure. And it is a movie that you can enjoy in your own language.

The 2016 version of Ben-Hur is not a faithful adaptation of the 1959 film or the 1880 novel. It makes several changes to the plot, characters and themes, some of which work better than others. For instance, the relationship between Judah and Messala is more complex and nuanced, as they are shown to have genuine affection and respect for each other before their political differences tear them apart. The film also gives more screen time and agency to the female characters, especially Esther, who becomes a follower of Jesus and tries to persuade Judah to forgive his enemy.
 
However, some of the changes are less successful and undermine the impact of the story. The film reduces the role of Jesus, who is only seen briefly and vaguely in a few scenes. His crucifixion is shown as a background event that coincides with Judah and Messala's final confrontation. The film also downplays the religious and spiritual aspects of the story, and focuses more on the action and spectacle. The film's message of love and forgiveness is diluted by its emphasis on violence and revenge.
 
The film's biggest weakness is its lack of epic scope and grandeur. The film suffers from a low budget, poor CGI, choppy editing and bland cinematography. The film fails to recreate the iconic scenes of the 1959 film, such as the sea battle, the leper colony and the water miracle. The film also lacks the emotional depth and intensity of the 1959 film, as the actors deliver wooden performances and fail to convey the inner turmoil and transformation of their characters.
 
Ben-Hur is a disappointing remake that fails to live up to its source material and its predecessors. It is a mediocre action movie that does not capture the essence and spirit of the classic epic. It is a movie that you can skip in any language.
